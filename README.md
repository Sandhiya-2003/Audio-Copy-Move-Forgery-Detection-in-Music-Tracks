*Project Title*: Audio Copy-Move Forgery Detection in Music Tracks
Final Semester UG Project Submission â€“ B.E. CSE

*Project Summary*
This project presents a method for detecting copy-move forgeries in music tracks, where a segment is duplicated and reinserted within the same audio. Unlike speech data, music presents unique challenges due to its harmonic structures and genre diversity.

To address this, the project proposes:
    - Use of Constant-Q Transform (CQT) for spectrogram generation
    - Division into seven octave-aligned subbands
    - Extraction of multi-domain features (spectral, temporal, statistical, tonal)
    - Training a 1D Xception deep learning model to classify audio as original or forged

*Key Features*: 
    - Dataset: 2,500 original instrumental music tracks from 10 diverse genres (Source: https://freemusicarchive.org/)
    - Realistic copy-move forgeries created through audio augmentation using Librosa, Scipy and pydub
    - Features Extracted from CQT Octave Subbands
    - 1D Xception model using depthwise separable convolutions
    - Achieved: 97.24% test accuracy and 0.9723 F1-score

*Results*:

    The proposed method using **CQT spectrogram with octave subbanding** and a **1D Xception model** significantly outperformed the baseline STFT-based approach.
    
    *CQT vs STFT Performance Comparison*:
    
    | Feature Representation      | Accuracy | F1 Score |
    |-----------------------------|----------|----------|
    | CQT Subbands + Xception | 97.24%   | 0.9723   |
    | STFT + Xception             | 78.83%   | 0.7858   |
    
    - *CQT* provides logarithmic frequency scaling, better capturing musical harmonics and tonal variations.
    - *STFT* suffers from limited resolution at low frequencies, making it less effective for detecting music forgeries.
    - The CQT-based model also demonstrated consistent performance across all 10 music genres, confirming its robustness and generalization ability.
  
    These results confirm that **CQT with subband features** is better suited for music-based audio forgery detection than traditional STFT.
