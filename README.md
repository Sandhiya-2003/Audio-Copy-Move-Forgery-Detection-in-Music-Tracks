*Project Title*: Audio Copy-Move Forgery Detection in Music Tracks
Final Semester UG Project Submission â€“ B.E. CSE

*Project Summary*
This project presents a method for detecting copy-move forgeries in music tracks, where a segment is duplicated and reinserted within the same audio. Unlike speech data, music presents unique challenges due to its harmonic structures and genre diversity.

To address this, the project proposes:
    - Use of Constant-Q Transform (CQT) for spectrogram generation
    - Division into seven octave-aligned subbands
    - Extraction of multi-domain features (spectral, temporal, statistical, tonal)
    - Training a 1D Xception deep learning model to classify audio as original or forged

*Key Features*: 
    - Dataset: 2,500 original instrumental music tracks from 10 diverse genres (Source: https://freemusicarchive.org/)
    - Realistic copy-move forgeries created through audio augmentation using Librosa, Scipy and pydub
    - Features Extracted from CQT Octave Subbands
    - 1D Xception model using depthwise separable convolutions
    - Achieved: 97.24% test accuracy and 0.9723 F1-score

*Results*:
    - The proposed method using **CQT spectrogram with octave subbanding** and a **1D Xception model** significantly outperformed the baseline STFT-based approach.
    
*CQT vs STFT Performance Comparison*:
    
| Feature Representation      | Accuracy | F1 Score |
|-----------------------------|----------|----------|
| **CQT Subbands + Xception** | **97.24%**   | **0.9723**   |
| STFT + Xception             | 78.83%   | 0.7858   |

*CQT* provides logarithmic frequency scaling, better capturing musical harmonics and tonal variations. *STFT* suffers from limited resolution at low frequencies, making it less effective for detecting music forgeries. The CQT-based model also demonstrated consistent performance across all 10 music genres, confirming its robustness and generalization ability.

| Genre        | Accuracy | F1 Score |
| ------------ | -------- | -------- |
| Classical    | 97.37%   | 0.9730   |
| Country      | 98.68%   | 0.9867   |
| Electronic   | 94.74%   | 0.9474   |
| Folk         | 96.05%   | 0.9600   |
| Hip Hop      | 98.68%   | 0.9870   |
| Jazz         | 96.05%   | 0.9610   |
| Old Historic | 98.68%   | 0.9867   |
| Pop          | 94.74%   | 0.9474   |
| Rock         | 98.68%   | 0.9870   |
| Soul R\&B    | 98.68%   | 0.9867   |

- These results confirm that **CQT with subband features** is better suited for music-based audio forgery detection than traditional STFT.
